# -RAG-Chatbot-with-Streaming-Responses
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Flan-T5 and FAISS to enable document-based Q&amp;A with source-backed answers.   The chatbot ingests documents, processes them into chunks, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves the most relevant chunks during queries.
